Credit Score Breakdown
Here’s the lowdown on how a user’s credit score is cooked up:

Loan Utilization Ratio (25%): How much of their approved credit limit are they currently using on active loans? Ideally, sticking around 30% usage is the sweet spot (source). The closer they are to this, the better their score.

EMI Payment Behavior (30%): The ratio of EMIs paid on time versus late payments. Bonus points if they pay early! The more upfront they are, the more brownie points they rack up.

Average Loan Tenure (15%): Customers who usually take loans with longer repayment periods earn a higher score because it signals trustworthiness.

Age of Oldest Loan (10%): The longer a customer has been managing loans, the more reliable they’re considered, so older loans boost their credit rating.

Number of Loans Taken (20%): The more loans a customer has successfully handled, the higher their rating climbs.

Loan Approval Rules
How loans get greenlit based on that credit score:

If Credit Score > 50: Loan gets approved, no questions asked.

If Credit Score is between 30 and 50: Loan can be approved but only if the interest rate is above 12%.

If Credit Score is between 10 and 30: Loan approval only if interest rate is above 16%.

If Credit Score < 10: Nope, no loan approval here.

Also, if the total EMIs a customer pays each month exceed 50% of their monthly salary, loan approval is denied — gotta keep those finances balanced.

If the given interest rate doesn’t match the credit score-based rules, the system automatically adjusts it in the response.
